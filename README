Wyvertux -- a(n almost) GNU-free Linux distribution

Wyvertux is an experimental Linux distribution that aims to completely
remove GNU utilities (if it's even possible) from the Linux build system.

This kiss-repo-compliant git repo contains these directories:
- main: all packages which doesn't need GNU components on run-time
        (packages which has a make dependency on a GNU package is fine,
         but patch it if possible.)
- gnu: for packages made by the GNU project
- encumbered: for packages which needs GNU libraries

Wyvertux is still on very early development. There are no usable rootfs
for the time being.

DIFFERENCES FROM KISS
=====================

Almost the same, but for the packaging system, a mandatory file should
be added to the package directory (license). The first line should be
an SPDX Identifier of the license (if the program is dual-licensed, put
the other licenses on the next line), and if the license itself is not
contained in the licenses package, the following lines must be composed
of the license notice, with any exceptions that might be applicable
must also be included.

KISS Linux is intended to be a minimal distribution, Wyvertux is not.
If you intend to use a minimal KISS but still wants to go fully-LLVM,
head over to Wyverkiss.
