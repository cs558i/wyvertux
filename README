Wyvertux -- a(n almost) GNU-free Linux distribution

Wyvertux is an experimental Linux distribution that aims to completely
remove GNU utilities (if it's even possible) from the Linux build system.

This kiss-repo-compliant git repo contains these directories:
- core: essential packages for Wyvertux to run and build from the rootfs
- extra-toolchain: additional packages for Wyvertux to build core and
                   other things, like kernel
- extra-boot: packages needed to build and boot the distro
- extra: additional packages that might be useful to your workflow
- gnu: for packages made by the GNU project that will be needed

Wyvertux is still on very early development. Use at your own risk.
